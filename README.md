The "things":


## Bloom Growth task sync with Microsoft To Do at scale

This solution is a collection of workflows that allows organisations who use Bloom Growth to automatically synchronise tasks to Microsoft To Do, for all users.

It utilises Power Automate to do the work, and Microsoft Graph to create the tasks in To Do.

You can see the [full explanation of the solution here](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2023/02/25/synchronising-tasks-at-scale-between-bloom-growth-and-microsoft-to-do/).



## Create-To-Do-task-from-Teams-message
(this is no longer required as the functionality is now native in Microsoft Teams)

This Power Automate flow is as the name implies - you can create a task in To Do from any Teams chat or channel message.

You can see an [overview and demo of it here](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2021/02/19/a-simple-workflow-to-create-a-to-do-task-from-microsoft-teams-messages/).



## Home-office-availability-display

This Power App displays your current availability as well as upcoming appointments.

Designed to be used on a tablet mounted outside of your home office door, to show your availability to family members.

You can [see it in action and an overview here](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2021/03/27/build-your-own-home-office-room-display-system/).

## MVP Renewal Checker

This Power App displays whether you have been renewed as a MVP or not by checking whether you have received an email with "Congratulations" in the subject from the Microsoft Global MVP account.

Created for the "scheduled maintenance" trolling as part of the MVP annual renewal cycle of 2022, and for literally no other purpose.

You can see a [demo of it here](https://twitter.com/LoryanStrant/status/1543446263626354688).



## What is my ID app

One of the challenges with shared channels in Microsoft Teams is that collaboration with external parties may require knowing their Azure Active Directory object ID, in order to configure cross-tenant relationships.

This app makes it easier for users to be able to retrieve at least their own ID to provide to a colleague, to provide to their IT team, to grant access.
