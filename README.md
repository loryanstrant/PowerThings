## The "things"

### Create-To-Do-task-from-Teams-message

This Power Automate flow is as the name implies - you can create a task in To Do from any Teams chat or channel message.

You can see an [overview and demo of it here](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2021/02/19/a-simple-workflow-to-create-a-to-do-task-from-microsoft-teams-messages/).


### Home-office-availability-display

This Power App displays your current availability as well as upcoming appointments.

Designed to be used on a tablet mounted outside of your home office door, to show your availability to family members.

You can [see it in action and an overview here](https://www.loryanstrant.com/2021/03/27/build-your-own-home-office-room-display-system/).


### MVP Renewal Checker

This Power App displays whether you have been renewed as a MVP or not by checking whether you have received an email with "Congratulations" in the subject from the Microsoft Global MVP account.
Created for the "scheduled maintenance" trolling as part of the MVP annual renewal cycle of 2022, and for literally no other purpose.
You can see a [demo of it here](https://twitter.com/LoryanStrant/status/1543446263626354688).
